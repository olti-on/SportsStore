@model IEnumerable<string>

@*I added a link called Home that will appear at the top of the category list and will list all of the products with no
    category filter. I did this using the ActionLink helper method, which generates an HTML anchor element using the
    routing information configured earlier.*@

@Html.ActionLink("Home", "List", "Product", null,
new { @class = "btn btn-block btn-default btn-lg" })



@*I then enumerated the category names and created links for each of them using the RouteLink method. This is
similar to ActionLink, but it lets me supply a set of name/value pairs that are taken into account when generating
the URL from the routing configuration.*@

@foreach (var link in Model)
{
    @Html.RouteLink(link, new {
    controller = "Product",
    action = "List",
    category = link,
    page = 1
    }, new {
    @class = "btn btn-block btn-default btn-lg" + (link == ViewBag.selectedCategory ? " btn-primary" : "")
    })
}
